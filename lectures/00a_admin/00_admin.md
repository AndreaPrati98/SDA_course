# Lectures' Timetable

* **Official**
	* Wednesday 14:15 - 16:15 in classroom 5.02
	* Thursday 16:15 - 18:15 in classroom 21.S.2
* **Pragmatically**
	* Tuesday 14:30 - 16:00 in classroom 5.02 
	* Thursday 16:15 - 17:45 in classroom 21.S.2
* **Important NOTES**
	* there is no clear cut between *theory* and *practice*
	* *bring your laptops* we will often code
	* I **record ALL lectures** but I do not stream them

# Lectures' Recording

* I **record** all lectures, and I **make them available the same day**
* I do **no**t **stream** the lectures **outside the classroom** (i.e., I can selectively admit people who are in the room)

---

# Objetives

The course provides the foundational concepts, methods, languages, and systems for **ingesting, processing, and analyzing data that flows** to enable real-time decisions. 

The course aims to tame the velocity dimensions of Big Data without forgetting the volume and variety dimensions.

# Expected learning outcomes 

* **Knowledge and understanding**
	* Students will learn how to **identify problems** that can be addressed with big data techniques tailored for **velocity** and apply the stream data analysis technologies for **solv**ing real-world problems
* **Applying knowledge and understanding**
	* Given specific **project cases**, students will be able to define and implement a streaming data analysis solution for the problem and apply it to natural data streams from social media and IoT sensors 
* **Making judgments**
	* Given specific project cases, students will be able to learn how to **decide** which streaming data analysis solution to apply and how to **evaluate** this decision 

---

# Expected learning outcomes
## Only those who will do the project

* **Communication** 
	* Students will learn to write a report on a project describing and motivating the decisions taken and the results obtained and present their work in front of their colleagues and teachers
* **Lifelong learning skills** 
	* Students will learn how to develop a realistic streaming data analysis project in all its phases 

---

# Evaluation - 

* The exam consist of three parts
	* a **mandatory** written exam
	* an *optional continuous evaluations* 
	* an *optional practical project work* with oral presentation
* **Example**: 
	* 27 written text
	* + 1 optional continuous evaluation 
	* + 3 optional practical project work 
	* = 30L

---

## Evaluation
# The "mandatory" written exam

* The written exam is composed of 
	* a mix of **theoretical questions** regarding any course subjects and
	* **exercises** regarding the technical content and how to apply it in practice. 
* Students can get **up to 30/30** in the written test.

---

## Evaluation
# The "optional" continuous evaluations

* The optional continuous evaluations are in-presence quizzes proposed **during the lessons**
* Students can get **up to 2 marks** with continuous evaluations

---

## Evaluation
# The "optional" practical project

* The optional practical project requires using one or more of the technologies presented in the lectures. 
* It **solve**s **a realistic** streaming data analysis **problem** based on actual or practical datasets publicly available or provided by the teachers. 
* Students can get **up to three marks** with the practical project
* **Only students, who will get at least 27/30 in the written exam, can opt for it.**
